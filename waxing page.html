  <p class="p1"> Waxing is hair removal from the root by covering the hair with a sticky substance (wax) that adheres to it.
  Waxing is beneficial because your hair will not grow back as fast as when shaving and it grows back thinner. Waxing consistently
eventually damages the hair follicle so that hair does not grow again, which is the ultimate goal. We do both hard wax and sugar waxing. Sugar
waxing is less painful however, hard wax is sometimes necessary.</p>
